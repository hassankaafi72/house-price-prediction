# 🏠 House Price Prediction Model

### 📊 Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict residential house prices. By analyzing various features like location, square footage, and number of rooms, the model provides an estimated market value for properties.

### ❓ The Problem
In the real estate market, pricing a house accurately is challenging due to the many variables involved. Manual estimation is often biased or inaccurate, leading to financial losses for buyers or sellers.

### 💡 The Solution
I developed a predictive solution using **Supervised Machine Learning**. 
- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values and outliers in the dataset.
- **Feature Engineering:** Selected the most impactful variables (e.g., area, neighborhood).
- **Modeling:** Implemented a **Linear Regression** algorithm to establish a relationship between house features and their prices.
- **Evaluation:** Tested the model's accuracy using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared.
